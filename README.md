# Heart-Attack-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This machine learning project aimed to predict if a patient is highly likely to have a heart attack based on his/her demographic and health information, which includes the following:  Age Sex Resting blood pressure Chest pain level Cholesterol level Fasting blood sugar level Angina type Resting ECQ results; and Maximum heart rate This project made use of Gaussian Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models in predicting the output which is whether a patient will have a heart attack or not. The two models were then compared for their accuracy and f1-scores to check which model performs best in predicting the results for each individual.
